<p class="ourProjectWorkIntro">
We are a team who have a different view and different experience, but we found common language and made a good project. During our project we had a lot of calls
for discuss what we should to do and separate our tasks. Pavel is the most experienced, and he decided to concentrate on working with
commercetools, he was reviewing our code and giving us advice on how to write it well. Kate worked with forms and validation, she also allows our application to look more
beautiful. Milana worked with appearance of main, catalog page and she also create routing.
